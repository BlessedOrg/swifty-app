## Getting Started

This example demonstrates how to use thirdweb Auth with NextJS.

To run the project, first clone this repository, and then run one of the following commands to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Next, you need to create a `.env.local` file and set the `THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY` variable to the admin private key you want to use for Auth, as well as the `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN` variable to the domain you want to use for Auth. Your `.env.local` file should look like the following:

```.env.local
THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN=example.com
```

Finally, you can run the project with one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Now, you can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to visit the client side page where you can connect a wallet, sign-in with ethereum and view the payload, and use the payload to authenticate with the backend.
